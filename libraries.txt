MotorMC uses several libraries to aid in cryptography, compression, and other essential functions.
Here are all of the libraries MotorMC uses:

( Library    - What it's used for                       <- Why it's used )

GMP          - RSA encryption and math                  <- Best solution
libTomCrypt  - cryptographic hashes, and AES encryption <- TODO replace for OpenSSL	(OpenSSL is faster)
libcURL      - auth requests                            <- Only solution with desired functions, relys on OpenSSL
libdeflate   - compression                              <- Best solution
